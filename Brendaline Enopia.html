<h2>More About Me</h2>
	<details>
	<summary>My Childhood</summary>
	 Ever since I was little, my parents have always told be to be strong in my education, and everything I did just kind of revolved around that. If my report cards were bad, which they rarely were, seeing as how I was always trying to please them, they would be disappointed and I always hated the thought of letting them down. </details>
